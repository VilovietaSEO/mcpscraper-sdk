# Changelog

All notable changes to `mcpscraper-sdk` and `mcpscraper-memory-sdk` are documented here. Each entry notes which product version(s) it was verified against.

## [Unreleased]
- Initial scaffold: contracts/ (OpenAPI spec for mcp-scraper, tool manifest for mcp-memory), packages/scraper, packages/memory.

## mcpscraper-cli 0.1.1
- Fixed npm-installed CLI execution by resolving the `.bin` symlink before checking the module entrypoint.
- Published the public CLI against `mcpscraper-sdk@0.3.0`.
- Removed the redundant direct memory SDK dependency; memory commands route through `mcpscraper-sdk`.
- Corrected Python installation documentation to use working GitHub source-package URLs until PyPI publishing is configured.

## mcpscraper-memory-sdk 0.2.0
- Expanded the generated client from 74 to 85 live memory tools.
- Added governed capture (`prepareMemoryWrite`, `validateMemoryWrite`, `memoryCapture`), canonical tag operations, vault contracts/routing, and memory graph backlinks/universe/path namespaces.
- Updated `libraryIngestTool` and `putTool` types to the live schemas from `mcpscraper-memory-tools@1.2.0` and verified against mcp-memory `1.6.0`.

## mcpscraper-sdk 0.3.0
- Updated `client.memoryTools` to the complete 85-tool contract and added typed `tags` and `graph` namespaces through `mcpscraper-memory-sdk@0.2.0`.

## mcpscraper-sdk 0.2.0
- Added `depositToVault`/`vaultName` to `extractUrl` and the `memory` response field (`VaultDepositResult`), reflecting mcp-scraper's scrape-to-vault feature.
- Added `POST /memory/mcp-call` to the contract and `client.memoryTools.*` to the SDK — all 74 memory.mcpscraper.dev tools, callable with only a scraper API key (reuses `mcpscraper-memory-sdk`'s generated namespace classes as a workspace dependency; no code duplicated).
- Verified against mcp-scraper `main` as of commit `b04db11` ("merge mcp-memory's 74 tools into the unified MCP surface") and `mcpscraper-memory-tools@1.1.0` (confirmed exact 74/74 tool-name parity against `contracts/memory.tools.json` — no changes needed there).
- `mcp-scraper-scheduler` (the new cron/automation worker mcp-memory's scheduling engine moved to) has no public API surface — confirmed via its own landing page copy — and is out of scope for this SDK.
